//There are so many kinds of Comparison opreators

console.log( 2 > 2);
console.log(2 == 2);
console.log(null== 0);
console.log(undefined == 0);

//You can use Comparison Opreator to compare the different values btut there are some draw backs 
//in This language because when we compare an empty null valued type with zero its give the answer
//false
